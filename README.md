Polyglot shell script (sh, bat/batch, powershell)

I was slightly obsessed with polyglot files the last week; [polyshell](https://github.com/llamasoft/polyshell) impressed me, but it bugged me that the BAT version printed "gibberish" on its first line. Could it be possible to get `@ECHO OFF` working on the first line? After a couple of dead ends, I was able to make it work! See the [souce](polyscript.sh) file.
